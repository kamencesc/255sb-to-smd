# 255SB Toggle Switch to a SMD Toggle Switch
If you are a kind of $%&# head and you has used a lot of 255SB Toggle Switch in your projects, just to realese when the first batch of 50 PCBs are in yout hand and... that the 255SB does't use a standard DIP (0.1" 2.54mm distance between pins), but there's no 255SB anywhere! Ebay, Aliexpres, LCSC... What can I do?

Just use one of this 3 adapters.

1. The first one is a simple adapter that uses a SMT male pin header and a SMT SPDT Toggle switch.
2. The second one is the first one but is double, same size as 2x255SB perfectly joined.
3. The third one a vertical hone, use a 90ยบ SMT male pinheader and a SMT SPDT Toggle switch at 90ยบ
